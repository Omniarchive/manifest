# Omniarchive Manifest

This is intended to be a replacement for Mojang's [version_manifest_v2.json](https://piston-meta.mojang.com/mc/game/version_manifest_v2.json) that includes more versions, more data for all versions, and is consistent as to how data is formatted across all versions. It can be accessed at `https://meta.omniarchive.uk/v1/manifest.json`.

The [main manifest JSON](manifest.md) references [individual version JSONs](versions.md). 
[JSON schemas](https://json-schema.org/specification) for both manifest and version files can be found [here](https://meta.omniarchive.uk/schemas/v1/manifest.schema.json) and [here](https://meta.omniarchive.uk/schemas/v1/client.schema.json), respectively. 
These links can also be found in the `$schema` field where applicable.

## Feedback and Bug Reports
If you have any feedback or bug reports, please open an issue in this repository. Issues that are not related to the
manifest itself will be closed.
